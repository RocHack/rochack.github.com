        <h1>A hacka-what?</h1>
        <p>Hackathon! It's an event about building the coolest thing you can in 36 hours and meeting awesome people. We don't place any limits on what you can build. Traditionally there are software projects but we'd love to see hardware, or whatever else people come up with as well. It just has to be built within the 36 hours.</p>
        <p>At the end of the 36 hours we have judges get together and determine the coolest hacks. Winners get awesome prizes!</p>

            <div class="eight columns faq-question">
                <h3>Do I bring anything?</h3>
                <p>Yep! Bring a laptop and anything else you need to get you into the coding zone. If you're from out of town and want to sleep make sure you bring a comfy sleeping bag!</p>
                <p>If you're interested in a hardware hack, bring along some equipment but <b class="hax">we will have plenty of toys for you to use in your project</b> if you need anything!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="eight columns faq-question">
                <h3>Do I have pay to attend?</h3>
                <p>No! The hackathon is completely free to all students who want to attend. The only thing you'll have to cover is transportation (if you're coming from other places) and some food.</p>

        <div class="container">
            <div class="eight columns faq-question">
                <h3>Will there be food?</h3>
                <p>Yes! We're still working out the details but we'll at least cover one or two of your meals while you're hacking. Worst case, if you're still hungry, we are 3 minutes away from The Pit (our a-la-carte dining hall in Wilson Commons).</p>

            <div class="eight columns faq-question">
                <h3>What if I don't have an idea?</h3>
                <p>Come anyways! We can help you find a team that already has an idea or we'll have a list of ideas from departments across campus that you can browse through. Regardless, we'll figure something awesome out for you!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="eight columns faq-question">
                <h3>What if I have a cool idea but don't know how to code?</h3>
                <p>If you're interested in learning how to program, you should totally come. Hackathons are a great way to get started with building your awesome idea for yourself! If coding isn't for you, we have <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1pP8NdXZ6Lss8DLcZRvmR63trHWgC9doqi2d3eH4m8i8/viewform">a form for outside ideas</a> that anyone at the hackathon can build if they don't have their own idea.</p>
